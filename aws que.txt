1. What is AWS IAM? 
The Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management service is like a security guard at the door to Amazon Web Services. This is where Azure Services and its environment are authenticated and authorized. The basic building blocks of AWS IAM are IAM roles, IAM users, groups and policies.



 2. Define AWS users and groups? 
IAM users can be people or applications that interact with the AWS environment services and its resources. An IAM user is an identity created in AWS to access various AWS resources and services. A user has permissions associated with it. The permissions define which actions that user can perform on a specific resource. 
IAM groups are collections of IAM users. Users are organized into groups so you can assign permissions in bulk rather than individually for each user. In addition, permissions are automatically inherited, making it easier to control how resources are accessed within your account.


3. What are the best practices you will follow while creating IAM users? 
We should always create individual IAM users for each person needing access to AWS services. Even if there are many employees who require the same access, we should create individual IAM users for all of them. This increases the security posture by providing every user of IAM a unique set of credentials. 



4. Explain AWS IAM Policies. 
IAM Policies are how you determine who has access to what resources in your account. For example, you could allow users access to all Amazon EC2 instances within your AWS account, or just a specified instance.





5. AWS policies are of two types: 
Identity-based policies: This is the policy that binds with AWS identities, such as a users, group, or role. IAM policies are an example of that. These policies can be either Amazon Web Services managed or customer-managed.  

Resource-based policies: AWS resource-based policies are the ones that can be tied directly to Amazon Resources like a bucket policy (S3). Resource-based policies are only available for certain services. 






6. What are the best practices you would follow while creating any IAM Policy? 
When granting permissions, we should follow the least privileged principle. We should avoid giving users or roles more permissions than they need to accomplish their tasks by following this principle. For example, if an employee needs only access to a specific EC2 instance, specify the instance in the IAM policy. Rather than granting an employee access to every instance in your AWS account. 



7. Please explain the IAM Policy Structure. 
We can create IAM policies from the AWS web console and by the visual editor using the JASON-based policy editor. If you take a look into the JASON policy document it basically consists of below elements:  
Effect — Decides whether the resource is allowed or denied (Allow/Deny)  
Action — A set of service-specific parameters  
Resource — Resource names  
Condition (Optional) — Grant conditions 




8. Define AWS IAM roles. 
An IAM role is a temporary way to access permissions through your identity. 




9. What is a Root user? 
The Root User is the Owner Account (administrator) that is created when the AWS Account is created. By default, it has access to all AWS services and resources. It is not possible for IAM Policies to explicitly deny this user access to AWS services or resources. 




 10. How do you revoke access rights? 
If you need to revoke access rights from an existing user, it’s simple. Simply click on Manage Permissions on his or her profile page and select Revoke Access. You’ll be presented with a list of all services to which they are granted access; check each service that is correct and then click Revoke Access in the bottom right corner.




11. What is MFA in AWS IAM? 
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security for users accessing AWS resources. In addition to a username and password, an MFA-enabled user must provide a one-time code generated by an authenticator app or sent via SMS or voice call before gaining access. An MFA device can be enabled on your computer, phone, or tablet. 




12. Is it possible to monitor the activity of IAM users?  
Yes, IAM users’ activities can be monitored. In case of a violation, you can remove the IAM user’s access.



13. What are IAM users’ access keys? 
Each IAM user receives an access key along with a secret key. Users can use their access keys to authenticate themselves to Amazon Web Services when they launch an instance, run a command, or call an API. If you lose your access key, please make sure that you terminate all instances and delete any resources linked to them before creating a new one. If you lose your secret key, we recommend deleting all related resources in order to minimize potential harm. 




14. What is Access control to AWS resources? 
The first step in securing your resources is using access control lists (ACLs) to allow or deny access. An AWS account has an owner, so you need an access key and secret key when using ACLs with any service. Make sure you keep these keys safe! The first step in securing your resources is using access control lists (ACLs) to allow or deny access. An AWS account has an owner, so you need an access key and secret key when using ACLs with any service.





15. Which are the key features of AWS IAM? 
Access control to AWS resources 
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
Federated access 
Analytics 






16. Explain best practices to manage access to AWS resources? 
Do not use root accounts – Since root accounts have access to all the AWS resources and services, it is not a good idea to share or use them. 
Use Groups – Create groups, grant access to them, and add users to them – so that all users within the group have the same access. 
Enable Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) – MFA should be enabled for privileged users such as admins. MFA adds an additional layer of security. 
Grant least privileges – Only grant permissions that are necessary for the user or group.

3. What is the use of AWS S3?
S3 is Amazon’s object storage service. Using Amazon Simple Storage Service, we can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet at any time.




4. What is an Object in AWS S3?
The Amazon S3 object store lets you store any number of objects using unique keys. The objects can be stored in one or more buckets, and each bucket can hold up to 5 TB of data.



5. What is Key in AWS S3?
Keys are unique identifiers of objects within a bucket. Each bucket has exactly one key. An object is uniquely identified by its bucket, object key, and optionally, version ID (if Simple Storage Service Versioning is enabled for the bucket). As a result, you can think of Amazon Simple Storage Service as a basic mapping between “bucket + key + version” and the actual object.




6. Explain S3 Versioning.
The Amazon S3 Versioning feature allows you to keep multiple variants of the same object in the same bucket. Objects stored in S3 buckets can be preserved, retrieved, and restored with Simple Storage Service Versioning. It is easy to recover from both unintentional user actions and application failures.



7. What is Bucket Policy?
Bucket policies allow you to grant access permissions to objects within your bucket by using AWS IAM policies. A bucket policy can only be associated with the bucket owner. An owner of a bucket can assign permissions to any object in the bucket that is attached to the bucket.
You may want to check step by step guide to create S3 bucket policy.




8. What is Access control lists (ACLs) ?
The ACL allows you to grant read-only and write-only access to individual buckets and objects to authorized users. ACLs are attached to buckets and objects as sub-resources. ACLs are an older access control system for defining the which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access.




9. How large can a Simple Storage Service bucket be?
You can store an unlimited amount of data and objects in an Simple Storage Service bucket. The size of a single Amazon S3 object can range from 0 bytes to 5 terabytes. An object of around 5 GB can be uploaded in a single upload request but Multipart Upload must be enabled.



10. Explain the benefits of S3 versioning.
We can store multiple variants of an object in a bucket by versioning it. An object can be restored to a previous or specific version by versioning. If an object is deleted or accidentally overwritten, versioning can be used to recover it.





11. How to configure S3 Versioning on a Bucket?
Versioning helps you keep multiple versions of an object in one place. Follow these steps to enable versioning on an S3 bucket.
Login to your AWS account.
Choose Simple Storage Service service.
Choose a bucket for which versioning should be enabled.
Go to the properties tab.
Select versioning from properties.
Click on the OK button to enable versioning.





12.  Is Simple Storage Service considered as DFS?
Simple Storage Service is not a distributed file system, but rather a binary object store. It is structured like a filesystem and is often used like one. Each bucket is a new database (meaning, folder), with keys as folder paths and values as binary objects (i.e. files).






13. How to create an S3 bucket?
To create an AWS S3 bucket check our solution blog for the same.



14. Can I Upload Files Using The AWS Console?
Yes, you can use either of two ways to upload files using AWS Console. One way is by clicking on Objects and selecting your bucket, then uploading a file to it. The other way is by navigating through a bucket’s properties. This is useful if you need to include objects that are not visible in your console, such as large audio or video files.




15. What is the command to list objects in Simple Storage Service bucket?
To list all files or objects under a specified directory or prefix, use the aws s3 ls –recursive command on the AWS CLI .




16. What are the Storage Classes available in Amazon S3?

ACL helps manage objects via access control lists.
S3 Access Points Helps manage data sets using access points specific to each application.
Bucket policies help in managing resources and permissions.




19. How do I delete an AWS S3 bucket?
For deleting an AWS Simple Storage Service  bucket, follow these steps:
Log in to the Amazon Web Services Management Console.
Select the Simple Storage Service.
Locate the bucket you wish to delete.
Press the delete button. AWS will ask you to type the bucket name you wish to delete.
Enter the bucket name and click Confirm.

2. What is the full form of EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud



3. What is an Instance in EC2?
An instance is a virtual server running apps on AWS EC2. An instance may represent a small segment of a single machine, that has a separate hard drive or OS, etc. From one physical machine you may have multiple little computers (Virtual machines) which are referred to as Instances.




4. Why do we use EC2?
Amazon EC2 allows you to create as many or as few virtual servers as you need, manage security and networking, and configure storage in real time. Amazon EC2 lets you scale up or Scale down your workload as needed to meet changing business requirements. This way, you’re able to manage unexpected surges without sacrificing availability.



5. What do you mean by Spot instances in AWS EC2?
AWS Spot Instances let you make use of unused EC2 capacity on the AWS cloud. You can get Spot Instances at up to 90% off On-Demand prices. Spot Instances can be used for a variety of stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications, such as big data, containerized workloads, etc.





6. What is Reserved instances in AWS EC2?
Reserved Instances are provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for customers to use for a variety of tailor-made uses. Amazon provides EC2 Reserved Instances at an hourly rate as well as an optional reservation of capacity for such instances at the same time.





7.  Explain the benefits of AWS EC2.
Reliability: Each Amazon EC2 region in the Amazon Web Services network has an SLA of 99.9% availability. Thus, instance replacement is simple and fast.
Security: Amazon implements Amazon VPC to deliver stable networking and security. The compute instances reside in a virtual private cloud (VPC) that is logically partitioned with a specific IP range.
Flexibility: Choosing an EC2 instance can involve different factors such as types, software packages, instance storage, and operating systems. You can configure the memory, CPU, and boot partition size to suit the operating system and application.
Cost Saving: EC2 is cost-effective because it enables consumers to configure plans to suit their needs. This will allow them to save money and maximize their resources. Amazon has such great savings because the power and scale of their EC2 instance is significantly lower in cost, compared to the other cloud providers.





8. What are the categories available in Reserved instances in AWS?
Standard RIs
They are ready to be used on a steady stage. There is a 75% discount on their On-Demand instances.
Convertible RIs
If you create another RI of equal or greater value in exchange, you can adjust RI’s attributes. You can also use convertible RIs for steady-state computations. For On-Demand instances, they offer discounts up to 54%.

Scheduled RIs
By utilizing recurring, predictable RIs, you can schedule your capacity reservations to be completed within only a few days, weeks, or months. You can activate scheduled RIs at any time within your allocated timeframe.
